                <hr>
                <div class="date">February XX, 2020</div>

                <p>Motivated by rising tuition and increasing student loan balances, local, state, and federal policymakers are considering new ways to reduce college costs, especially for low- and middle-income students.</p>
                <p>Cities and states have already introduced several “free college” plans, primarily in the form of College Promise programs. Nearly half of all states have a program that provides tuition-free college for some segment of its population.  And its seems like nearly every Democratic presidential candidate has a plan to provide more students with free or low-cost education.</p>
                <p>A federal free college program could dramatically increase the number of students who could attend college for free, but much depends on the choices legislators make. Which students, and which institutions, will be eligible? Which college expenses will be covered? Our interactive shows how the answers to these questions dictate which students would benefit from a broad free college plan.</p>

                    <section class="step" data-step="3"><p>As you can see, about 27 students (i.e., 27 percent of students) attending college in the United States currently have free college. These students receive merit-based grants (like Louisiana’s TOPS awards), or need-based grants (such as the federal Pell grant), and those grants were sufficient to cover the year’s tuition and fees at their school.</p></section>

                        <p>Free college is often proposed to “level the playing field” by making college more affordable for low-income students.</p>
                        <p>Looking at the share of students receiving free college by income, we see that some high-income students get free college, and many low-income students—especially students who are older or are independent of their parents—don’t.</p>

                        <p>Now that we’ve seen who already gets free college, let’s think about the free college plan we might put in place. One of the key debates among Democratic presidential candidates is whether access to free college should be universal.</p>

                    <section class="step" data-step="7">
                        <p>However, when states implement free college, they often impose an income ceiling for eligibility, like in Washington and New York. Similarly, we will implement a cap at or below 400 percent of the federal poverty level, which is $49,960 for a single person or $103,000 for a family of four in 2019. Anyone with a household income below that is eligible for free college under our plan.</p>

                        <p>This 400 percent cap is relatively generous so it’s no surprise that the number of students receiving free college increases dramatically to about 79 percent of students.</p>

                        <p>We can also see the effects of free college plans on students of different races and ethnicities.</p>
                        <p>Students who are Black or Hispanic are more likely to get free college under our plan. Although White students make up about 53 percent of college students, a smaller share of white students would receive free college under our plan.</p>

                        <p>Still, many currently enrolled students of color, like Justina, will lose out on the benefit of free college. One reason for this is the disproportionate share of black and Hispanic students at for-profit colleges. Students may opt for a for-profit institution because they live far from a public college or because the for-profit  meets their needs better (e.g., by providing night classes).</p>

                        <p>Free college is sometimes touted as a means to help students reduce, or even eliminate, their need for student loans. If we provide eligible students with full tuition and fees, how might this affect the share of students who need to take on debt to attend college?</p>

                        <p>Even with free tuition and fees, student debt likely won’t go away. Of those who had free college before our new policy, a substantial share also had student loans. And many of those who receive free college under our plan may continue to rely on student loans.</p>
                        <p>Beyond tuition and fees, students also need to pay for housing, food, transportation, and, in some cases, childcare, while in school. Some students, particularly those in four-year schools, cover these costs with federal student loans.</p>

                <p>The idea of broadening access to free college is an appealing and important one, but how it is designed hinges on our underlying goals as a country.</p>
                <p>If we want to provide universal access to college, we may want to prioritize making all two-year public institutions free, since those institutions are open to all who enroll. If our goal is to reduce student loans, we need to consider funding living expenses for low-income students. And if we want to close gaps in college access for students of color, we may need to think about how to support students who are in non-public institutions.</p>
                <p>These choices can change students’ lives, but may also have ripple effects that can shape higher education and federal and state budgets in significant ways.</p>
