                <h1>You get free college! And you get free college! And you!</h1>

                <div class="date">February XX, 2020</div>

                <p>Motivated by rising tuition and increasing student loan balances, local, state, and federal policymakers are considering new ways to reduce college costs, especially for low- and middle-income students.</p>
                <p>Cities and states have already introduced several “free college” plans, primarily in the form of College Promise programs. Nearly half of all states have a program that provides tuition-free college for some segment of its population.  And its seems like nearly every Democratic presidential candidate has a plan to provide more students with free or low-cost education.</p>
                <p>A federal free college program could dramatically increase the number of students who could attend college for free, but much depends on the choices legislators make. Which students, and which institutions, will be eligible? Which college expenses will be covered? Our interactive shows how the answers to these questions dictate which students would benefit from a broad free college plan.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="graphic">
                <div id="vis"></div>
                <div id="sections">
                    <section class="step"><p>These hundred dots represent the population of undergraduate students in the United States. Hover over the dots to learn more about each student.</p></section>
                    <section class="step"><p>Although this simplified dataset doesn’t precisely indicate which students will get free college, we use this 100-dot pool to predict the broad effects of different policy choices.</p></section>
                    <section class="step"><p>Policymakers disagree on which college expenses should be free. For now, we will use “free college” to mean that students pay nothing in tuition and fees. Those costs are covered by merit-based or need-based grants.</p></section>
                    <section class="step"><p>As you can see, about 27 students (i.e., 27 percent of students) attending college in the United States currently have free college. These students receive merit-based grants (like Louisiana’s TOPS awards), or need-based grants (such as the federal Pell grant), and those grants were sufficient to cover the year’s tuition and fees at their school.</p></section>

            </div>

            <div class="content afterScroll">
                <p>The idea of broadening access to free college is an appealing and important one, but how it is designed hinges on our underlying goals as a country.</p>
                <p>If we want to provide universal access to college, we may want to prioritize making all two-year public institutions free, since those institutions are open to all who enroll. If our goal is to reduce student loans, we need to consider funding living expenses for low-income students. And if we want to close gaps in college access for students of color, we may need to think about how to support students who are in non-public institutions.</p>
                <p>These choices can change students’ lives, but may also have ripple effects that can shape higher education and federal and state budgets in significant ways.</p>
