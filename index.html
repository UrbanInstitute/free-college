                <h2>Investigating Who Would Get Free College</h2>
                <hr>
                <div class="date">February XX, 2020</div>

                <p class="navDotStep" id="intro">Motivated by <a href="https://research.collegeboard.org/pdf/trends-college-pricing-2018-full-report.pdf" target="_blank">rising tuition</a> and <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/about/data-center/student/portfolio" target="_blank">increasing student loan balances</a>, local, state, and federal policymakers are considering new ways to reduce college costs, especially for low- and middle-income students. </p>
                <p>Cities and states have already introduced several “free college” plans, primarily in the form of <a href="http://ahead-penn.org/creating-knowledge/college-promise" target="_blank">College Promise programs</a>. Nearly half of all <a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/2018-02-01/these-states-offer-tuition-free-college-programs" target="_blank">states</a> have programs that provide tuition-free college for some students. And its seems like <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/6/24/18677785/democrats-free-college-sanders-warren-biden" target="_blank">nearly every Democratic presidential candidate</a> has a plan to provide more students with free or low-cost education.</p>
                <p>A federal free college program could dramatically change the landscape of higher education, but much depends on the choices legislators make. Which students, and which institutions, would be eligible? Which college expenses would be covered? Our interactive feature shows how the answers to these questions could dictate which students would benefit from a broad free college plan.</p>

                        <p>Now that we’ve seen who already gets free college, let’s think about the free college plan we might put in place. One of the key debates among Democratic presidential candidates is whether access to free college should be universal.</p>

                        <p>But when states implement free college, they often impose an income ceiling for eligibility, like in Washington and New York. Similarly, we will implement a cap at or below 400% of the <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/federal-poverty-level-definition-guidelines-chart-3305843" target="_blank">federal poverty level</a>. In 2019, this cap would amount to $49,960 for a single person or $103,000 for a family of four. Anyone with a household income below that threshold is eligible for free college under our plan.</p>

                        <p>This 400 percent cap is relatively generous, while 27 percent of students receive free college currently, 81 percent receive it under this plan.</p>

About 16 percent of students who would be eligible based on family income still have tuition bills, because they are not enrolled in a public school. Slightly more than half are enrolled in nonprofit private schools, and the remainder are enrolled in for-profit institutions.</p>

                <p class="navDotStep" id="conclusion">Expanding the population of people who have access to affordable college is a valuable policy goal. But predicting the response to such a massive policy shift is challenging.</p>
                <p>If we have a national free college plan, states and localities might reduce their funding for public institutions, causing the federal government to shoulder more of the cost. Nearly all proposals have mechanisms to keep states invested, but this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/20/upshot/50-reasons-free-college-misunderstood.html" target="_blank">may require trade-offs</a>.</p>
                <p>Right now, <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/issue-briefs/2015/06/federal-and-state-funding-of-higher-education" target="_blank">52 percent of total funding</a> for education at public institutions comes from state and local funds. Since some states invest more funding in higher education than others, the federal government will need to understand how to allocate funds equitably.</p>
                <p>The idea of broadening access to free college is an appealing and important one, but how such a plan is designed hinges on our underlying goals.</p>
                <p>If we want to provide universal access to college, we may want to prioritize making all two-year public institutions free, since those institutions are open to all who apply. If our goal is to reduce student loans, we need to consider funding living expenses for low-income students. And if we want to close gaps in college access for students of color, we should think about how to support students who are in nonpublic institutions.</p>
                <p>Whatever choices we make regarding free college, whether to maintain the current system or overhaul the funding of higher education, they will shape federal and state budgets and students’ lives for decades to come.</p>

                    <h4>About the data</h4>
                    <p>We estimate the effects of a free college policy using data from the 2015–16 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:16), a nationally representative survey of students enrolled in postsecondary education in the United States.</p>
                    <p>Although the NPSAS:16 provides the most comprehensive student financing data available, it has limitations. The net cost of college attendance is not available for the 10 percent of undergraduate students who attend more than one institution during the year. For this reason, we cannot determine the free college status of these students, and we did not include them in the 100-person sample.</p>
                    <p>We did not include international students and students registered in a nondegree program in the representative sample, as these students are not typically included in free college proposals. For more information, see the technical appendix.</p>
