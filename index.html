                <div class="date">February XX, 2020</div>

                <p class="navDotStep" id="intro">Motivated by <a href="https://research.collegeboard.org/pdf/trends-college-pricing-2018-full-report.pdf" target="_blank">rising tuition</a> and <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/about/data-center/student/portfolio" target="_blank">increasing student loan balances</a>, federal policymakers are considering new ways to reduce college costs, especially for low- and middle-income students.</p>
                <p>Cities and states have already introduced several “free college” plans, primarily in the form of <a href="http://ahead-penn.org/creating-knowledge/college-promise" target="_blank">College Promise programs</a>. Nearly half of all <a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/2018-02-01/these-states-offer-tuition-free-college-programs" target="_blank">states</a> have programs that provide tuition-free college for some students. And its seems like <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/6/24/18677785/democrats-free-college-sanders-warren-biden" target="_blank">nearly every Democratic presidential candidate</a> has a plan to provide more students with free or low-cost education.</p>
                <p>A federal free college program could dramatically change the landscape of higher education, but much depends on the choices legislators make. Which students, and which institutions, would be eligible? Which college expenses would be covered? Our interactive feature shows how the answers to these questions could dictate which students would benefit from a broad free college plan.</p>

                            <p>About 27 percent of students (i.e., 27 students in our world) attending US colleges currently have free college.

                            <p>Now that we’ve seen who already gets free college, let’s think about the free college plan we might put in place. One of the key debates among Democratic presidential candidates is whether access to free college should be universal.</p>

                            <p>But when states implement free college, they often impose an income ceiling for eligibility, like in Washington and New York. Similarly, we will implement a cap at or below 400 percent of the <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/federal-poverty-level-definition-guidelines-chart-3305843" target="_blank">federal poverty level</a>. In 2019, this cap would amount to $49,960 for a single person or $103,000 for a family of four. Anyone with a household income below that threshold is eligible for free college under this plan.</p>

                            <p>This 400 percent cap is relatively generous; although 27 percent of students receive free college currently, 81 percent receive it under this plan.</p>

                            <p>But many of these students attend private institutions, which typically aren’t included in free college plans. What happens when we limit our plan to public colleges and universities?</p>

                            <p>Restricting our plan to two- or four-year public institutions means 65 percent of current students would receive free college. About 25 percent of students who would be eligible based on family income still have tuition bills, because they are not enrolled in a public school. Slightly more than half are enrolled in nonprofit private schools, and the remainder are enrolled in for-profit institutions.</p>

                            <p>The plan described here is more likely to benefit students of color.

One reason is the <a href="https://civilrights.org/edfund/2019/10/17/civil-rights-groups-for-profit-colleges-exploit-black-and-latino-students/" target="_blank">disproportionate share of Black and Latino students</a> at for-profit colleges.

                            <p>Free college is sometimes touted as a means to help students reduce, or even eliminate, their need for student loans.

                            <p>Even without tuition and fees, student debt won’t go away. Nearly a quarter of students who already have free college also have student loans.

                            <p>Beyond tuition and fees, students also need to pay for housing, food, transportation, and, in some cases, child care while in school. Some students, particularly those in four-year schools, cover these costs with federal student loans.</p>

                <p>If a national free college plan is put in place, states and localities might reduce their funding for public institutions, causing the federal government to shoulder more of the cost. Nearly all proposals have mechanisms to keep states invested, but this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/20/upshot/50-reasons-free-college-misunderstood.html" target="_blank">may require trade-offs</a>.</p>
                <p>Right now, <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/issue-briefs/2015/06/federal-and-state-funding-of-higher-education" target="_blank">52 percent of total funding</a> for education at public institutions comes from state and local funds. Since some states invest more funding in higher education than others, the federal government will need to understand how to allocate funds equitably.</p>
                <p>The idea of broadening access to free college is an appealing and important one, but how such a plan is designed hinges on our underlying goals.</p>
                <p>If providing universal access to college is a priority, policymakers may want to make all two-year public institutions free, since those institutions are open to all who apply. If the goal is to reduce student loans, policymakers need to consider funding living expenses for low-income students. And to close college graduation gaps for students of color, policymakers should explore strategies in addition to free college, such as providing <a href="https://www.mdrc.org/publication/doubling-graduation-rates" target="_blank">more comprehensive supports</a> outside of tuition and fees.</p>
                <p>Whatever choices we make regarding free college, whether to maintain the current system or overhaul the funding of higher education, they will shape federal and state budgets and students’ lives for decades to come.</p>

                    <h4>About the data</h4>
                    <p>We estimate the effects of a free college policy using data from the 2015–16 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:16), a nationally representative survey of students enrolled in postsecondary education in the United States.</p>
                    <p>Although the NPSAS:16 provides the most comprehensive student financing data available, it has limitations. The net cost of college attendance is not available for the 10 percent of undergraduate students who attend more than one institution during the year. For this reason, we cannot determine the free college status of these students, and we did not include them in the 100-person sample.</p>
                    <p>We did not include international students and students registered in a nondegree program in the representative sample, as these students are not typically included in free college proposals. For more information, see the technical appendix.</p>
